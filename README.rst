decompyle3
==========

A native Python cross-version decompiler and fragment decompiler.
A reworking of uncompyle6_.


Introduction
------------

*decompyle3* translates Python bytecode back into equivalent Python
source code. It accepts bytecodes from Python version 3.7 on.

For decompilation of older Python bytecode see uncompyle6_.

Why this?
---------

Uncompyle6 is awesome, but it has has a fundamental problem in the way
it handles control flow. In the early days of Python when there was
little optimization and code was generated in a very template-oriented
way, figuring out control flow-structures could be done by simply looking at code patterns.

Over the years more code optimization, specifically around handling
jumps has made it harder to support detecting control flow strictly
from code patterns. This was noticed as far back as Python 2.4 (2004)
but since this is a difficult problem, so far it hasn't been tackled.

The initial attempt to fix to this problem was to add markers in the instruction stream,
initially this was a `COME_FROM` instruction, and then use that in
pattern detection.

Over the years, I've extended that to be more specific, so
`COME_FROM_LOOP` and `COME_FROM_WITH` were added. And I added checks
at grammar reduce type to make try to make sure jumps match with
supposed `COME_FROM` targets.

However all of this is complicated, not robust, and not really tenable.

So in this project we'll address control flow directly via
the python-control-flow_ project.

I expect it will be a while before this is as good as *uncompyle6* for
Python 3.7, but if decompilation is to have a future in Python, this
work is necessary.


Requirements
------------

The code here can be run on Python versions 3.7 or later. The bytecode
files it can read have been tested on Python bytecodes from versions
3.7 and later.

Installation
------------

This uses setup.py, so it follows the standard Python routine:

::

    pip install -e .  # set up to run from source tree
                      # Or if you want to install instead
    python setup.py install # may need sudo

A GNU makefile is also provided so :code:`make install` (possibly as root or
sudo) will do the steps above.

Running Tests
-------------

::

   make check

A GNU makefile has been added to smooth over setting running the right
command, and running tests from fastest to slowest.

If you have remake_ installed, you can see the list of all tasks
including tests via :code:`remake --tasks`


Usage
-----

Run

::

$ decompyle3 *compiled-python-file-pyc-or-pyo*

For usage help:

::

   $ decompyle3 -h

Verification
------------

If you want Python syntax verification of the correctness of the
decompilation process, add the `--syntax-verify` option. However since
Python syntax changes, you should use this option if the bytecode is
the right bytecode for the Python interpreter that will be checking
the syntax.

You can also cross compare the results with another python decompiler
like unpyc37_ . Since they work differently, bugs here often aren't in
that, and vice versa.

There is an interesting class of these programs that is readily
available give stronger verification: those programs that when run
test themselves. Our test suite includes these.

And Python comes with another a set of programs like this: its test
suite for the standard library. We have some code in `test/stdlib` to
facilitate this kind of checking too.

Known Bugs/Restrictions
-----------------------

**We support only released versions, not candidate versions.** Note however
that the magic of a released version is usually the same as the *last* candidate version prior to release.

We also don't handle PJOrion_ obfuscated code. For that try: PJOrion
Deobfuscator_ to unscramble the bytecode to get valid bytecode before
trying this tool. This program can't decompile Microsoft Windows EXE
files created by Py2EXE_, although we can probably decompile the code
after you extract the bytecode properly. For situations like this, you
might want to consider a decompilation service like `Crazy Compilers
<http://www.crazy-compilers.com/decompyle/>`_.  Handling
pathologically long lists of expressions or statements is slow.


There is lots to do, so please dig in and help.

* https://github.com/andrew-tavera/unpyc37/ : indirect fork of https://code.google.com/archive/p/unpyc3/ The above projects use a different decompiling technique than what is used here. Instructions are walked. Some instructions use the stack to generate strings, while others don't. Because control flow isn't dealt with directly, it too suffers the same problems as the various `uncompyle` and `decompyle` prorgrams.
